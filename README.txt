In this app, I utilized Django's built-in admin interface to change the data for a mock message board of a SQLite backend.
I finally pushed the project to a Bitbucket repo and deployed the app to the Heroku cloud platform.
Although the product of this project is very simple, I am excited at how it has taught the basics of how backends work with a frontend.
